          Following recent advances in technology and the development of ultra high-throughput research, the field
          of biotechnology is beginning to suffer from data overload, and thus, applications of Bioinformatics &
          Computational Biology have expanded with these so-called ‘-omic‘ technologies. This discipline now sits as
          an umbrella over biotechnology. The Utah State University Bioinformatics Lab aims to provide academic
          researchers with high-performance computing resources. More information on our other websites below.

          There's a reason we keep developing new tools at the KAABiL: finding new ways to process -omics data is an endless task.
          If you need data processed, our Bioinfocore website has details on what kinds of processing we do, as well as manuals for
          users on our HPC. You can also find out about our system specifications as well as what software we have installed on
          our HPC.
